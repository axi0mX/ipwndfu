### Your checklist for this pull request
🚨Please review the [guidelines for contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) to this repository.

- [ ] Make sure you are requesting to **pull a topic/feature/bugfix branch** (right side). Don't request your master!
- [ ] Rebase to `main` locally to prevent messy commits
- [ ] This may sound obvious but get a device out and test that the program works.  (One day we
  may have better test infrastructure but for now this is required)
- [ ] Check the commit's or even all commits' message styles matches our requested structure.
  And no profanity in commit messages as they go out to Discord / are immutable.
- [ ] Link your PR to a open GitHub issue to ensure that the rationale is not repeated and the
  issue is closed when the PR is accepted.
- [ ] Check your code additions will fail neither code linting checks nor unit test.  This is done by 
  setting up `pre-commit` in your local workspace.  GitHub actions will also verify quality and will
  prevent you from merging without it.

💔Thank you!
